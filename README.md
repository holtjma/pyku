# pyku
The goal of this project is to have some fun making functional python code that can be read as a [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku)
in the classic 5-7-5 form.  Hopefully, this will build up to some fun complexity over time.  Enjoy!

### Self-imposed rules

1. Every pyku is functionally correct, meaning that given expected input values it will provide the correct result.  See the unit tests for examples.
2. Every pyku will only use built-in python functions or sub-routines that are also pykus.  This rule may be relaxed in the future.
3. Every pyku will followed the 5-7-5 form when read out loud.  The way code is verbally "read" is up to debate, so the developer's interpretation is included in the comment for each pyku.

### Things pykus are not

1. While every pyku is functionally correct, they are not necessarily algorithmically efficient.  This is for fun after all!
2. While every pyku is functionally correct, it's probably a bad idea to use this for any real application.  But hey, I won't stop you okay?
